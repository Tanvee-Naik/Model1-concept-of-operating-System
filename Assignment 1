It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.

Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable— sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s  how  the math works out: if you can  get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.
